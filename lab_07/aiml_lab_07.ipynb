The addition of this non-linear function allows learning **non-linear relationships** between random input and target variables. As a result, this technique is part of the **non-linear** type of regression techniques, which can be distinguished from the **linear** type as shown in the following illustration:"

    "A couple things might be worth noting here. First, the Area Under the Curve (AUC) is higher for $t = 0.2$ than for the other $t$ values, despite highest accuracy belonging to $t = 0.5$. This might seem counter-intuitive at first, but both values are not directly comparable and do not work in the same way. For instance, if the huge majority (say 90%) of the real labels are 0s (no churn), and our classifier naively classifies all samples as 0s, it will get 90% accuracy. However, we might get a very low AUC score (maybe close to 0.5.). The AUC score tells us how well the classifier is able to distinguish between the different classes. This example is similar to what happens when $t = 0.8$. When $t = 0.8$, accuracy is decent because predictions are mostly 0s, and the majority of samples are actually 0s. But the classifier is actually bad at distinguishing the two classes, so the AUC is low. The AUC is a very relevant measure."
